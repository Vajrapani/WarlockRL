OpeningLines = [[You have made a blood pact with Thoth, daemon of knowledge. Harvest the souls that slither beneath the ground here to prove your worth and, in turn,  be rewarded with unimaginable power.

Thoth has bestown upon you a spellbook that is overflowing with his chaotic magic. Many such fantastical acts can be performed using it, the only cost is souls.
Use it well.]]
